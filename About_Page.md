# NHS App Dashboard v1.4

## Data Caveats:
- GP Registered Patients data is not available for a small proportion of GP practices. Any metrics that use this measure as a denominator (e.g. Proportion of GP population registered for the NHS App) will have a slightly higher than expected rate.

- The dashboard displays data only for GP practices that are currently active. Should a practice close, their historical data will no longer appear in the dashboard.

## Version 1.3 Change Log (29-09-2020)

### 1. User Verification Process 
To improve the Appâ€™s user registration journey and increase digital uptake, a 2-tier verification process has been implemented for new App users. The two tiers are as follows: 
- Partially Verified (P5) users - Requiring Name, Email, D.O.B, Postcode and Mobile Number 
- Fully Verified (P9) users - Requiring Photo ID and Photo/Video Identity Matching 
Partially verified (P5) users cannot access confidential information, and have limited access to App features until fully (P9) verified. 

### 2. Updated Registration Metric 
The 'NHS App Registrations' metric has been updated to give a count of new App users who have obtained full (P9) verification. The dashboard has now been updated to account for this change and will resume weekly updates.

As a result of the new verification process and developments to the App over time, a new method for tracking user acquisition has been established. Previously, patients moving practice may have been assigned a new Linkage Key, and would therefore have been counted as a new app user. Data prior to May-2020 has been updated to reflect the new tracking method made possible by the new verification system, which avoids the risk of duplication. This may result in a slightly lower registrations count at practice level prior to May-2020.
