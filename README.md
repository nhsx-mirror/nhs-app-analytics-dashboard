## Background to the NHS App dashboard
The NHS App dashboard is provided by NHSX, NHS Digital, and NHS England and Improvement. It enables those working in the health and care system to monitor the adoption and uptake of the NHS App. This information can then support strategic decision making at all levels of the system.
